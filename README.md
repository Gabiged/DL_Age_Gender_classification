The task of this work is to make one model to predict age and gender.

The model used for this work was pretrained ResNet 50 as optimizers: AdamW, RMSprop.
And to explain the results I used LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) as a great tool designed to provide interpretable explanations for the predictions (regression and classification in this case).
